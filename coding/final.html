<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>As a student, I have gained valuable work experience through various academic and extracurricular activities. I actively participated in school events, where I helped organize functions and assisted teachers in managing classroom tasks. I was also involved in group projects and team-based assignments, which helped me develop strong collaboration and communication skills. Serving as a class monitor enhanced my leadership abilities and taught me how to take responsibility and manage time efficiently. During vacations, I contributed to my family business, where I learned basic customer service and money-handling skills. Additionally, I provided tutoring support to classmates in subjects like Mathematics and Science, improving both my teaching and subject knowledge. These experiences have helped me grow as a responsible, organized, and hardworking individual, preparing me for future academic and professional opportunities.</p><hr></hr>
